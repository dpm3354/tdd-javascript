Notes on TDD in Javascript for RentPath 

January, 2020


TDD
Chap 9

Are you feeling a little unsure? Take smaller steps. TD is a steering process - a little this way, a little that way. No right sized step.



Chapter 10
Rather than apply minutes of suspect reasoning, we can just ask the computer by making the change and running the tests.

Sometimes you should just ask the computer.

Chapter 11, 

Remove the Franc and Dollar classes.

Chapter 12

Use of interface again

Fake the implementation of reduce in bank.


Left off at Chapter 13. 

I got stuck here, Kyle was helping me with this, he got stuck too.

This is the place where the book starts to get very OOP. Javascript doesnâ€™t work well with this.

I decided to have the TDD course (Day 2) stop at this point, at Chapter 12. But have them read the rest.
