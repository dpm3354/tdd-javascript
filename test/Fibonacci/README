Fibonacci Numbers Example

Notes:

* I gave this as homework after Chapter 17 
* Students able to do this or StringCalculator - their choice
* Its too much to give fib or strcalc AND chapters 18-20.  18-20 are time consuming if students don't know python


mine01
* test to get 0 back for 0
* test to get 1 back from 1
* the default implementation was obviously recursive at this point.  (all tests pass from now on -> done)
